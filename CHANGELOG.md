# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Watched episodes (up to your AniList progress) are marked with a ✓ and dimmed in the episode, download and delete lists.

## 0.2.0 – 2026-10-18

### Added

- Unfinished downloads come back. If ani-hop quits, crashes or its terminal closes while downloads are running, the next start asks whether to resume them. Yes continues where yt-dlp stopped; No removes the partial files.
- Starting an episode shows what it is waiting on (searching ani-cli, checking the source, fetching the stream, opening the player) right on the episode and in the status bar, then `▶ playing` once mpv is up.

### Fixed

- Quitting during a download no longer leaves ani-cli's ffmpeg fallback running in the background, writing a partial episode that looks finished.
- Pressing enter again while an episode is starting no longer opens a second player.
- A download whose source lookup fails no longer leaves the "left" counter stuck, so quitting doesn't ask about downloads that aren't running.

## 0.1.0 – 2026-10-18

First release: trending, top rated and search with posters in Ghostty and kitty, streaming and bulk downloads through ani-cli with ani-skip, AniList lists and progress sync, fzf-style menus.
